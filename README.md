# Heart-Disease-Data
# ABSTRACT: 
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a dataset that contains various health-related features. The primary objective is to explore the relationship between different medical attributes and the presence of heart disease, ultimately developing a predictive model to assist in early diagnosis and treatment decisions.
The analysis begins with an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), which includes data cleaning, handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Features such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are examined for their influence on heart disease outcomes. Feature engineering is also employed to create a new variable, the cholesterol-to-age ratio, which enhances model interpretability and performance.
Four machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—are trained and evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance. The models are assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
The results demonstrate that Random Forest achieves the highest predictive accuracy, effectively distinguishing between patients with and without heart disease. The project underscores the importance of rigorous data preprocessing and model evaluation in predictive analytics, offering valuable insights for healthcare practitioners. By integrating machine learning techniques, this project contributes to the growing field of health informatics, promoting better decision-making processes in clinical settings.
